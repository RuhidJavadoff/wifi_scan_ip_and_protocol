# Wi-Fi Scanner Script üì°

This Python script is designed to scan for Wi-Fi networks in your vicinity on the Windows operating system and display their basic information.

---

## üîç What It Provides:

The script uses the `netsh wlan show networks` command to provide the following information:

* **Network Name (SSID):** The name of the Wi-Fi network.
* **Signal Quality:** The signal strength of the network (usually as a percentage).
* **Security Protocol:** The type of security the network uses (e.g., WPA2, WPA3, Open).

---

## üö´ Limitations:

This simple scanner script cannot directly obtain certain information:

* **IP Address:** The internal or external IP addresses of surrounding networks cannot be learned through such scans due to security reasons.
* **Public/Private Status:** Whether a network is encrypted (security protocol) indicates if it's "private" or "open" (unencrypted). The script does not directly state "public" or "private."
* **Speed (Mbps):** While signal quality gives an idea of speed, the script does not directly show the network speed (Mbps).
* **Host:** The router hostnames of other networks cannot be obtained through this scan.

---

## üöÄ How to Use:

1.  **Save the Script:** Copy the Python code above and save it on your computer with a name like `wifi_scan.py`.

2.  **Open CMD as Administrator:**
    * Type `cmd` in the Windows search bar.
    * Right-click on the "Command Prompt" application that appears and select "Run as administrator."

3.  **Navigate to the Folder:** In CMD, go to the folder where you saved the `wifi_scan.py` file. For example, if you saved it to your desktop:
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` with your actual Windows username.)

4.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python wifi_scan.py
    ```
